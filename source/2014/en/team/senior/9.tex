\problem
There are $n > 1$ balls in a box.
Two players $A$ and $B$ are playing a game.
At first, $A$ can take out $1 \leq k < n$ ball(s).
When one player takes out $m$ ball(s), then the next player can take out
$l$ balls, where $1 \leq l \leq 2 m$.
The person who takes out the last ball wins.
Find all positive integers $n$ such that $B$ has a winning strategy.
