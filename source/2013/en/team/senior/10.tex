For integers $a_1$, $a_2$, \ldots, $a_r$ greater than 1, let us define
$[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r]$ as
\[
    \cfrac{1}{
        a_1 - \cfrac{1}{
            a_2 - \cfrac{1}{
                \ddots - \cfrac{1}{a_r} } } }
.\]
Given two finite sequences
$a_1$, $a_2$, \ldots, $a_n$ and $b_1$, $b_1$, \ldots, $b_m$
of integers greater than 1 such that
\[
    [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] + [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m] \geq 1
,\]
prove that there exist indices $n_1$ and $m_1$ 
($1 \leq n_1 \leq n$ and $1 \leq m_1 \leq m$)
such that
\[
    [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_1}] + [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{m_1}] = 1
.\]

% Counter-hint:
%   first solution was severly modified in Russian version,
%   while second was enhanced with lemma (which it was silently using anyway)
