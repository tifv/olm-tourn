\problem
Baron Munchausen wrote 10 real numbers on the blackboard and wrote down their sum on a sheet of paper.
With one operation he replaced one or more numbers on the board with their reciprocals, and again wrote down the sum on the same piece of paper. 
Is it possible that he wrote down the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, 500$ on the piece of paper as a result of 500 such operations?
