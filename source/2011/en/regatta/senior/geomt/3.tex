\problem
Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be points on a line with $B$ between $A$ and $C$, $AB = 3$
and $BC = 5$.
If $BMN$ is an equilateral triangle, find the smallest possible value of
$AM + CN$.
\solution
%Consider point $N'$ on line $BN$, with $B$ between $N$ and $N'$ and
%$BN' = 5 BN / 3$, and apply Ptolemy's inequality on $ANBN'$.
%The answer is $7$, and is attained when $ANBN'$ is convex and cyclic.
