\problem
A group of several people is said to be \emph{connected} if it cannot be
partitioned into two nonempty subgroups so that no two persons in different
subgroups are unacquainted.
In a connected group, every person knows exactly four others, and the four
acquaintances of each person form a connected subgroup.
Prove that the people in this group can be ordered around a circle so that
every two neighbors are acquainted.
