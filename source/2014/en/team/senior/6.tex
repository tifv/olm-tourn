\problem
Through the center of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ an arbitrary line $l$
is drawn that intersects the sides $AB$ and $BC$ in points $D$ and $E$.
A point $F$ is constructed, so that $AE = FE$ and $CD = FD$.
Prove that the distance from $F$ to the line $l$ does not depend on the
choice of $l$.
