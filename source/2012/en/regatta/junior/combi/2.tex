\problem
A mathematical olympiad was held in two days, each day with the same number of
problems, denoted with numbers from $1$ to $N$.
It turned out that, for each contestant, the numbers of problems he solved in
the two days differ by $1$.
On the other hand, for each number from $1$ to $N$, the numbers of contestants
who solved the problems with that number in the two days differ by $2$.
Show that the number of contestants was even.
