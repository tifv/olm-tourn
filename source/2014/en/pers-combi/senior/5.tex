\problem
A diamond lies on each square of a chessboard, so that each pair of diamonds
in the adjacent (along the side) squares differ in weight by less than 1 carat.
Prove that these diamonds can be placed into the squares of the rectangle
$2 \times 32$, so that diamonds in each pair of neighbouring squares still
differ by less than 1 carat.
