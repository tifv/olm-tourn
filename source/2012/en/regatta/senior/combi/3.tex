\problem
On some cells of a board $100 \times 100$ there are heaps of checkers.
In each step, one can choose a heap and move it through the row or column by as
many cells as there are checkers in the heap.
Initially, on each cell there is one checker.
Is it possible to gather them all onto one cell in $9999$ steps?
