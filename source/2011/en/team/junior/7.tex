Points $P$ and $Q$ on the side $AB$ of a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ are such
that $AP = QB$.
Point $X$ ($X \neq D$) is an intersection point of the circumcircles of
triangles $APD$ and $DQB$, and $Y$ ($Y \neq C$) is an intersection point of the
circumcircles of triangles $ACP$ and $QCB$.
Prove that the points $C$, $D$, $X$ and $Y$ lie on a circle.
