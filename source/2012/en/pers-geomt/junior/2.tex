\problem
In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with the parallel sides $AD$ and $BC$, the diagonals are
orthogonal.
The line parallel to $AD$ and passing through the intersection of the diagonals
meets the lateral sides $AB$ and $CD$ at points $K$ and $L$ respectively.
Point $M$ on side $AB$ is such that $AM = BK$.
Prove that $LM = AB$.
