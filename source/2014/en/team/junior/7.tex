\problem
Written on a blackboard is the polynomial $x^2 + x + 2014$.
Sasha and Fedya take turns alternately (starting with Fedya) in the following
game.
At his turn, Fedya must either increase or decrease the coefficient of $x$
by 1.
And at his turn, Sasha must either increase or decrease the constant
coefficient by 1.
Fedya wins if at any point in time the polynomial on the blackboard at that
instant has integer roots.
Prove that Fedya has a winning stratergy.
