\problem
A quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed into a circle, given $AB > CD$ and $BC > AD$.
Points $K$ and $M$ are chosen on the rays $AB$ and $CD$ respectively in such a
way that $AK = CM = \frac{1}{2} (AB + CD)$.
Points $L$ and $N$ are chosen on the rays $BC$ and $DA$ respectively in such a
way that $BL = DN = \frac{1}{2} (BC + AD)$.
Prove that the $KLMN$ is a rectangle of the same area as $ABCD$.

\solution 
From given equalities one get that $KB=MD$, and $K$ is lying on the segmet $AB$,
and point $D$ is lying on segment $MC$. Similarly $NA=LC$, $L$ on segment $BC$, and $A$ on segment $ND$. In triangles $MCL$ and $KAN$ the equalities $NA=CL$, $KA=MC$ and $\angle NAK=angle LCM$ hold. Thus, the triangles $MCL$ and $KAN$ are equal and $NK=ML$.
In the same wsy one get that $\triangle KBL=\triangle MDN$ and $KL=MN$. Consequently $KLMN$ is a parallelogram. One easily get that $\angle KLM=180^\circ-\angle KLB-\angle MLC=180^\circ-\angle MAD-\angle KNA=180^\circ-\angle KNM$. So the oposite angles of parallelogram have the sum equal to $180^\circ$. This can be true only in case of rectangular. So it's enough to show that the quadrilaterl $ABCD$ has the same area as rectangular $KLMN$. For this let $F$  be an intersection point of the segments $ML$ and $AD$. Then the chain of equalities take place 
\[
S_{ABCD}=S_{AKLF}+S_{KBL}+S_{LCM}-S_{MFD}=S_{AKLF}+S_{MDN}+S_{MAK}-S_{MFD}=S_{KLMN}.
