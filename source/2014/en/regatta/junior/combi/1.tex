Around the table sit several knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. The first person said: "If you don't count me, there are one more knaves than knights here", the second one said: "If you don't count me, there are two more knaves than knights here", and so on until the last one. How many people could be sitting around the table?
