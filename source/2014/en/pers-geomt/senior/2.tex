\problem
In a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ the angles $\angle B$ and $\angle D$
are equal.
It turned out that the intersection points of adjacent angle bisectors
of $ABCD$ form a convex quadrilateral $EFGH$
($E$ lies on the bisectors of the angles $\angle A$ and $\angle B$, $F$~---
$\angle B$ and $\angle C$ etc.).
Let $K$ be the intersection point of the diagonals of $EFGH$.
Rays $AB$ and $DC$ intersect at the point $P$, rays $BC$ and $AD$~---
at the point $Q$.
Prove that $P$ lies on the circumcircle of the triangle $BKQ$.
