A regular hexagon is divided into $54$ congruent equilateral triangles
(fig.~\ref{2011/en/team/junior/8:problem:fig}).
The $37$ vertices of these small triangles are arbitrarily denoted with natural
numbers from $1$ to $37$.
We call a small triangle \emph{good} if, going along its sides from the
smallest number to the largest one, we move clockwise.
Prove that there must be at least $19$ good triangles.
