Prove that for each natural number $m$ there is a natural number $k$ for which
$m \mid 3^{k + 1} - 2^k - k$.
\solution
%Define the sequence $(x_n)$ by $x_0 = 2$ and $x_{n+1} = 3^{x_n + 1} - 2^{x_n}$.
%It suffices to show that, for each $d$, $x_{n+1} \equiv x_n \pmod d$ holds for all sufficiently large $n$, as taking $k = x_n$ for $d = m$ will work.
%We prove this by induction on $d$.
%For $d = 1$ it is trivial.
%By the inductive hypothesis, $x_n \equiv x_{n-1} \pmod {\varphi(d)}$ for all sufficiently big $n$.
%Then for $x_n$ big enough, $3^{x_n + 1} \equiv 3^{x_{n-1} + 1}$ and
%$2^{x_n} \equiv 2^{x_{n-1}} \pmod d$, which also imply $x_{n+1} \equiv x_n \pmod d$, finishing the induction.
