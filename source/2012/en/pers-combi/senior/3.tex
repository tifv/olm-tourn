\problem
There were $10$ teams on a football tournament and every two teams played one
match, but the scoreboard was lost and only the numbers of goals scored and
conceded for each team were saved.
However, from these $20$ numbers, the results of all matches can be
reconstructed.
At least how many of these 20 numbers can be zeroes?
