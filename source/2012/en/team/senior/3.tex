There are $17$ apparently equal coins on a circle, but we know that some two
neighboring coins are fake.
All genuine coins weigh the same, and each fake coin is lighter than a genuine one by
$1$ gram.
We use a \emph{fragile} balance, which falls apart if the difference between the two
sides exceeds $1$ gram (while showing which side prevailed).
How can we determine the two fake coins by two measurements without weights?

<FIXME: Missing English solution.>
