\problem
A square building of size $40 m \times 40 m$ is divided by corridors into
$5 m \times 5 m$ squares.
At each vertex of each smaller square there is a switch.
Flipping a switch simultaneously turns the light (on $\leftrightarrow$ off) in
all $5$-meter corridors going out of that vertex.
Initially, the building is in complete darkness, and a guard starts from one of
its corners.
He can only walk along lit corridors.
A switch can be flipped arbitrarily many times.
Can he move in such a way that, from some moment on, he can walk from any point
to any other without flipping any more switches?
