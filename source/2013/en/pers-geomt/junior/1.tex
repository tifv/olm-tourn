\problem
Points $D$ on the side $AC$ and $E$ on the side $BC$ of triangle $ABC$ are such
that $\angle ABD = \angle CBD = \angle CAE$ and $\angle ACB = \angle BAE$.
Let $F$ be the intersection point of segments $BD$ and $AE$.
Prove that $AF = DE$.

\solution
It is easy to see that
\(
    \angle BAD = \angle BAE + \angle EAD
=
    \angle BCD + \angle CBD = \angle BDA
\)
(here we use the fact that outer angle of the triangle is the sum of two corresponding inner angles). Consequently $AB = BD$. In the same way obtain that
\(
    \angle BFE = \angle FBA + \angle FAB
=
    \angle EAD + \angle ECD = \angle BEF
\), and hence $BF=BE$. So the triangles $ABF$ and $DBE$ are equal, and $AF = DE$.
