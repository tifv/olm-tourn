Consider a triangle $ABC$ and concentric circles $\omega_b$, $\omega_c$
centered at $A$.
An arbitrary ray from $A$ intersects $\omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ at points $B'$
and $C'$ respectively.
The perpendicular bisectors of segments $BB'$ and $CC'$ meet at point $X$.
Prove that, as the ray from $A$ varies, all such points $X$ lie on a line.
