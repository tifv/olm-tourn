A tetrahedron $ABCD$ is given.
A sphere through points $A$, $B$ and $C$ intersects the lateral edges
$DA$, $DB$, $DC$ again at points $A_1$, $B_1$, $C_1$, respectively.
Points $A_2$, $B_2$, $C_2$ are the respective reflections of points
$A_1$, $B_1$, $C_1$ across the midpoints of the corresponding edges.
Prove that the points $A$, $B$ and $C$ are equidistant from the center of the
circumscribed sphere of tetrahedron $DA_2B_2C_2$.
