\problem
$A A_1$ and $B B_1$ are the altitudes in an acute triangle $ABC$, and $O$ is
its circumcenter.
Prove that the areas of the triangles $A O B_1$ and $B O A_1$ are equal.

\solution
Let us use the standart notation in triangle. Mentioned triangles have a pair of equal sides: $OA = OB$. The distance from $A_1$ to $OB$ can be calculated by formula
\(
    B A_1 \cdot \sin \angle CBO
=
    B A_1 \cos \alpha
=
    c \cos \beta \cos\alpha
\).
The same formula give us the distance from$B_1$ to$AO$. Thus, the areas are equal.
