\problem
There were $30$ teams on a football tournament.
It was noted after the tournament that, among any three teams, there were two
which scored the same numbers of points in mutual matches
(a win, draw, and loss are worth $3$, $1$ and $0$ points, respectively).
What is the smallest possible number of draws in such a tournament?
