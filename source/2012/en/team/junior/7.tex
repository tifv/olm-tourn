Several distinct natural numbers are written in a line.
We call a pair of neighboring numbers \emph{bad} if their sum is divisible by $7$ and
the larger of the two numbers is on the left, or if their sum is \emph{not} divisible
by $7$ and the larger number is on the right.
Every minute, the two numbers in some bad pair change places.
Prove that, at some moment, such changes must stop.
