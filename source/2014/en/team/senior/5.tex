\problem
The spheres $S_1$, $S_2$ and~$S_3$ are externally tangent to each other and all
are tangent to some plane at the points~$A$, $B$ and~$C$.
The sphere $S$ is externally tangent to the spheres $S_1$, $S_2$ and~$S_3$
and is tangent to the same plane at the point~$D$.
Prove that the projections of the point $D$ onto the sides of
the triangle $ABC$ are vertices of an equilateral triangle.
