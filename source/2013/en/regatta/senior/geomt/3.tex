\problem
A quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle.
$K$, $L$, $M$ and $N$ are chosen on the segments $AB$, $BC$, $CD$ and $DA$
respectively in such a way that
$AK = KB = 6$, $BL = 3$, $LC = 12$, $CM = 4$, $MD = 9$, $DN = 18$, $NA = 2$.
Prove that quadrilateral $KLMN$ can be inscribed into a circle.

\solution
The powers of $K$, $L$, $M$ and $N$ with respect to the circle equal to the
quantities $6 \cdot 6$, $3 \cdot 12$, $4 \cdot 9$, $18 \cdot 2$, and thus are
equal to each other.
Consequently, they are equidistant from the circumcenter of the $ABCD$.
Thus, points $K$, $L$, $M$ and $N$ are cyсlic with the same center.
