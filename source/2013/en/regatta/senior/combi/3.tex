\problem
Lets call a digit of a number \emph{valuable} if it occurs in decimal expansion
not more times than each of the other digits (it may not occur at all).
Peter generates an infinite sequence of numbers: he puts
any of the valuable digits of the number $n$ at the $n$-th place.
Can Peter obtain a sequence which is periodical from some point?
