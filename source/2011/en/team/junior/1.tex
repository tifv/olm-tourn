\problemmark{4}
There are $11$ coins in a row, and the weights of any two neighboring coins
differ by $1$ gram.
It is known that, among the coins that are not outermost, one has both
neighbors lighter than itself, while all others have one neighbor lighter and
one heavier than itself.
How can one find the heaviest coin in $2$ measuring on a scale without weights?
