\problem
The stair consists of 350 steps.
There are 350 stones on the bottom step of a stair.
All other steps are empty.
Each move Sisyphus can take from any step a group (one or more) of stones
(not necessarily all stones from the step), and shift the entire group up or
down by the number of steps equal to the number of stones in the group
(a group of one stone to the next or previous step, a group of two stones by
two step up or down, etc.).
Help Sisyphus shift all the stones to the next step with no more than
21 moves.
