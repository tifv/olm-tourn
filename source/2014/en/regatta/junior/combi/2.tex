\problem
Five Aborigines want to cross the river Limpopo in a boat which has place for two people. 
Initially, each of them has heard a rumour about somebody else, that this person is an Ebola virus carrier.
About each person somebody has heard that rumour.
If an Aborigine has heard the rumour about a person, he will not sit in the boat with him. 
The Aborigines do not talk on the banks of the river, but in the boat they exchange all rumours that are known to them. 
Is it possible that they (all five) will be able to cross the river anyway?
