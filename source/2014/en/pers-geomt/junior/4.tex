\problem
On the hypotenuse of a right triangle $ABC$ the points $M$ and $N$ are chosen
in such a way that $AM < AN$.
The line passing through $M$ that is perpendicular to $CN$ intersects
the line~$AC$ at the point $P$.
The line passing through $N$ that is perpendicular to $CM$ intersects
the line~$BC$ at the point $Q$.
Prove that the circumscribed circles of the triangles $APM$ and $BNQ$ and
the line $PQ$ intersect at one point.
