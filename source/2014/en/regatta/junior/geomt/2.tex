\problem
From the point $A_0$ black and red rays are drawn with a $7^\circ$ angle between them.
Then a polyline $A_{0} A_{1} \ldots A_{20}$ is drawn (possibly self-intersecting, but with all vertices different), in which all segments have length 1, all vertices with even numbers lie on the black ray and the ones with odd numbers --- on the red ray.
What is the index of the vertex that is farthest from $A_0$?
