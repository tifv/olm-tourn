\problem
In a country, there are $n$ provincial towns and the capital city.
The capital is connected with all other towns by direct airlines.
Moreover, there are direct airlines between some provincial towns, and between
any two provincial towns there is exactly one route not going through the
capital (and not visiting the same town twice, but with possible transfers in
other provincial towns).
The government wants to make each of these airlines one-way so that, after
departing from any town, it is not possible to return to that town.
In how many ways can the government achieve this?
(For example, for $n = 2$ there are $6$ ways.)
