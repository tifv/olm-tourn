\problem
The factory produces sets of $n > 2$ elephants of different sizes and masses.
The inspector checks each set separately.
As a standard, when the set is arranged so that masses go in ascending order,
the mass difference in each pair of adjacent elephants should be the same.
The inspector checks the sets with scales without weights.
What is the least possible $n$ such that this test can be organized
correctly?
