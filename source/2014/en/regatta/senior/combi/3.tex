\problem
For any coloring of the squares of the checkered board in black and white, the board is divided into connected coloured regions (in a chess colouring all regions consist of one square). 
Each step Petya selects one region and repaints it into the opposite colour. 
The repainted region is united together with the neighbouring regions of the same color, and the number of regions is reduced. 
What is the least number of steps that Petya needs to make the $13 \times 13$ board painted with chess pattern into a single-colour board?
