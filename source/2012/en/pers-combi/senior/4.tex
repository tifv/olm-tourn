\problem
Each vertex of a polyhedron with $n$ vertices is assigned two positive numbers,
blue and red, where the sum of blue numbers equals the sum of red ones.
In one step, one can alter the blue numbers in the endpoints of an edge of the
polyhedron, so that they remain positive and their sum is unchanged.
Prove that in at most $n-1$ steps one can achieve that each blue number be
equal to the corresponding red number.
