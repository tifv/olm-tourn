There are $n$ airports in some country, some of which are connected by two-way direct
airlines.
The set of airlines is connected: using them, it is possible to reach any airport from
any other.
Suppose that there are at least $k$ airports such that, if any of them is closed, the
set of the airlines will no longer be connected.
Given $n$ and $k \leq n - 2$, determine the greatest possible number of airlines in the
country.
