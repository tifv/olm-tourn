\problem
Two players alternately draw red and blue lines in the plane, which do not pass
through intersection points of other lines and are not parallel to other lines.
In each move, each player can arbitrarily choose the color of his line.
The game ends when each player draws $20$ lines.
The second player wants to produce as many intersection points of lines of
distinct colors as possible; the first player attempts to spoil his efforts.
What is the largest number of such intersection points that the second player
can always achieve?
\solution
