There is a cube with sides equal to $1 \text{\,m}$ and a set of five colors.
At first, Peter cuts the cube into equal smaller cubes of size at most $1 \text{\,cm}$
(he can choose the size).
Then Bob colors small cubes as he wants (not necessarily in the same way), but each face must be 	
one-colored.
Finally, Peter combines small cubes into original cube.
Show that Peter (regardless Bob's coloring)  can ensure that each face of large cube will be 	
one-colored.
