\problem
Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ lie on a circle in that order, where $AB$ and $CD$
are not parallel.
The length of arc $AB$ containing $C$ and $D$ is twice the length of arc $CD$
not containing $A$ and $B$.
Let $E$ be a point satisfying $AC = AE$ and $BD = BE$.
Suppose that the perpendicular from $E$ on the line $AB$ passes through the
midpoint of the arc $CD$ not containing $A$ and $B$.
Determine $\angle ACB$.
