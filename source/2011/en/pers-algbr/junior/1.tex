The natural numbers from $1$ to $2011$ are written on a blackboard.
Two players alternately erase one number each, until only two numbers, say $p$
and $q$, remain.
If none of the equations $x^2 + p x + q = 0$ and $x^2 + q x + p = 0$ has
integer solutions, the first player wins.
Can the second player prevent the first one from winning?
