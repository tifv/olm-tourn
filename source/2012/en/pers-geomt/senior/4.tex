\problem
Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle.
Denote by $I_A$ the center of the excircle at side $BC$ and by $A_1$ its
tangency point with the corresponding side.
Points $I_B$, $I_C$, $B_1$, $C_1$ are defined analogously.
Show that the circumcircles of triangles $A I_A A_1$, $B I_B B_1$ and
$C I_C C_1$ have two common points.
