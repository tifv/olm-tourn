\problem
100 different integer numbers are written on a blackboard.
Vasya replaces each number with either its square or its cube.
Then Vasya does the process one more time, replacing each number with either
its square or its cube (choosing the power independently each time).
What is the smallest number of different numbers that can be written
on the blackboard in the end?
