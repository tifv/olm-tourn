The natural numbers from $1$ to $1000$ are written on the blackboard.
Petya and Vasya play alternately, with Petya playing first.
In each move, some two numbers are replaced with their sum.
When only two numbers remain on the blackboard, if one is divisible by the
other, then Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.
Who has a winning strategy?
