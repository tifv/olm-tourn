There are $18$ weights with masses from $1$ to $18$ grams.
They are marked with numbers from $1$ to $18$, denoting mass, but two of the
marks have been exchanged.
Can we always determine the exchanged pair with $4$ measurings on a calibrated
scale (showing the total mass of weights being measured)?
