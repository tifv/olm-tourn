\problem
There are several (more than 3) towns in a country, and some of them are
connected by roads.
Suppose that, if any town is excluded, one can still travel between any two
cities without passing through the excluded town, but this condition is no
longer fulfilled if any road is closed.
Prove that no three of these towns are pairwise connected by roads.
\solution
