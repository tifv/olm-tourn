\problem
A \emph{lame scale} is a scale without weights which breaks after only two
instances of imbalance (when its two sides have different weights) and cannot
be used anymore.
One of $N$ coins is fake, lighter than the others.
What is the greatest $N$ for which one can find the fake coin with $k$
measurings on a lame scale?
