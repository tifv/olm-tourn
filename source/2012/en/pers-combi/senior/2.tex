\problem
There are $101$ saucers on a circle, each with a candy.
Lillebror chooses a natural number $f < 101$, and then Karlsson, knowing
Lillebror's number, chooses a natural number $s < 101$.
Lillebror takes the candy from some saucer.
Starting from this saucer, Karlsson counts the $s$-th saucer clockwise and
takes the candy from it.
Next, starting from that saucer, Lillebror takes the candy (if there is one)
from the $f$-th saucer clockwise.
Then, starting from that saucer, Karlsson takes the candy (if there is one)
from the $s$-th saucer clockwise, etc.
At most how many candies can Karlsson make sure to collect, no matter how
Lillebror plays?
