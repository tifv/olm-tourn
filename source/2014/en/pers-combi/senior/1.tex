\problem
A fly crawls along the edges of an octahedron, and, after creeping out of one
vertex on an edge it always reaches the other vertex (and cannot change
direction while moving along the edge).
Is it possible that at one moment it has visited one vertex 2014 times and all
the others~--- 650 times each?
