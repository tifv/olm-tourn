Eight numbers are written on a blackboard.
Two persons alternately play, and in each step two different numbers are
replaced with two equal numbers with the same sum.
The first player wins if, at some moment, the eight numbers can be partitioned
into two groups of four with equal sums.
Can the second player prevent him from winning?
