In a triangle $ABC$, points $M$ and $L$ on side $BC$ are the midpoint and the
foot of the bisector of angle $A$, respectively.
Points $P$ and $Q$ are the orthogonal projections of point $L$ on sides $AB$
and $AC$, respectively.
Point $X$ on the median $AM$ is such that $XL \perp BC$.
Prove that the points $P,X$ and $Q$ lie on a line.
