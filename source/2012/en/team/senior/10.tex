There are $2012$ plates in a line, numbered from $1$ to $2012$.
On the $k$-th plate there are exactly $k$ walnuts.
Two players are playing a game.
In each move, one can move several walnuts (at least one) from the $m$-th plate to the
$(m-1)$-th, where $m$ is chosen from $2$, $3$, $\ldots$, $2012$, or remove any number
of walnuts (at least one) from the first plate.
The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
Which player has a winning strategy?
