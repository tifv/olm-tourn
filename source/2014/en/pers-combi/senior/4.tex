\problem
A class won a prize in form of a bag with 2014 coins, that the class chairman
recieved (and all other students in the class have no money).
Each time two classmates meet, they split the money they have equally among
them if they have an even number of coins in total.
If the sum is an odd number, they give one coin to their teacher, and the rest
they split equally.
After a while the teacher got all the coins.
What is the minimum possible number of students in the class?
