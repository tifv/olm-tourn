Three rogues, each with two bags, want to cross a river.
They have a boat with three seats, each of which can be occupied by a person or
a bag.
However, neither of the rogues is willing to leave his bag with his companions
in his absence, although they would accept leaving it on an empty coast.
Can they cross the river?
