In some cells of an infinite square row there is a black or white piece, while
in the others there is none.
There are finitely many pieces in total, at most one in each cell.
We repeatedly perform one of the following two operations:
\\\emph{(i)}
if consecutive cells $A$, $B$, $C$ (in this order) are such that there are
pieces of different colors in $A$ and $C$, then we can remove a piece from $B$
if there is any, or put a piece of an arbitrary color in it otherwise.
\\\emph{(ii)}
if there is a piece in each of the consecutive cells $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$
(in this order), and the pieces in $A$ and $D$ have the same color, then we can
exchange the pieces in $B$ and $C$.
\\Prove that, by these operations, we cannot change the color of a piece lying
between two pieces of the same color, so that the content in every other cell
is the same as at the beginning.
