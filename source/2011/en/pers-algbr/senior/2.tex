\problem
Define the \emph{radical} $r(n)$ of a natural number $n$ as the product of its
distinct prime factors.
For example, $r(2000) = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$ and $r(2011) = 2011$.
A sequence $(a_n)$ is given by its first term $a_1$ and the relation
$a_{n + 1} = a_n + r(a_n)$ for $n \geq 1$.
Prove that there are a million consecutive terms in this sequence which form an
arithmetic progression.
