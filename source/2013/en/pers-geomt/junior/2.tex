\problem
A hexagon $ABCDEF$ is inscribed into a circle.
$X$ is the intersection point of the segments $AD$ and $BE$,
$Y$ is the intersection of $AD$ and $CF$,
and $Z$ is the intersection of $BE$ and $CF$.
Given $AX = DY$ and $CY = FZ$, prove that $BX = EZ$.

\solution
It's easy to see that $AX \cdot XD = AY \cdot YD$ (because $AX=YD$ и $AY=XD$).
Moreover $AY \cdot YD = FY \cdot YC$ (because $ACDF$ is inscrubed into a circle).
Similarly $FY \cdot YC = FZ \cdot ZC = EZ \cdot ZB$. From other hand $AX \cdot XD = BX \cdot XE$. Using all this stuff we obtain $BX \cdot XE = BZ \cdot ZE$.
Consequently $BX = ZE$, q.e.d.
