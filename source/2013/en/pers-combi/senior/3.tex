\problem
A rectangular board is divided into 99 rows and 99 columns by lines parallel to
its sides (so that there are $99 ^ 2$ rectangular cells).
Some of the cells are marked.
There are no two equal marked rectangles, and each unmarked rectangle is equal
to some marked one.
Is it possible that there are exactly 1999 marked rectangles?
