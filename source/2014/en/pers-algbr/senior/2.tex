Let $R(n)$ denote the number of ways to write a natural number $n$ as the sum $n = a + b$ of two primes (for example, $R(3) = 0$, $R(4) = 1$, $R(10) = 3$, since $10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5 = 7 + 3$).
Show that if $p < q$ are two consecutive prime numbers, then the sum
\[
    2 R (q - 2) + 3 R (q - 3) + 5 R (q - 5) + \ldots + p \cdot R (q - p)
\]
is divisible by $q$.
