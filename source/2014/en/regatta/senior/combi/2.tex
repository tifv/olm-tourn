\problem
100 Aboriginal people were able to cross the river of Limpopo from the left to the right, in a boat which has place for two people.
Initially, each Aborigine has heard a rumour about one or more of the others, that they are Ebola virus carriers.
The Aborigine would not sit in the boat with somebody who he has heard this rumour about.
On the left bank the spreading of the rumours is prohibited, but when the Aborigines reach the right bank, they come out of the boat, and everybody on that bank share all rumours with each other, and only then the boat returns.
What is the least possible number of Aborigines that had no rumours that they are virus carriers about them at all?
