\problem
On the sides $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$ of an acute triangle $ABC$ the points 
$A_1$, $B_1$ and $C_1$ are chosen respectively. The circumscribed circles of the triangles
$AB_1C_1$, $BC_1A_1$ and $CA_1B_1$ intersect at $P$. The points
$O_1$, $O_2$ and $O_3$ are the centres of these circles. Prove that
$4S(O_1O_2O_3)\geq S(ABC)$.
