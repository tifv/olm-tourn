\problem
At a school there are $200$ underachieving and $200$ overachievering students.
On the New Years Eve Santa Claus brought a bag with 800 chocolate pralines.
He want to give the pralines to the children so that the underachievers
will get no more than one praline each, and the overachievers will get
an even number of pralines each and at least 2.
The headmaster wants to encourage the overachievers additionally by giving away
600 tangerines, at least one tangerine to each overachiever.
Who has more ways to distribute the gifts and how many times more?
