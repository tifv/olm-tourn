\problem
There are $2011$ representatives from three tribes along a circle: knights,
liars and conformists.
Knights always tell the truth, liars always lie, while a conformist lies only
if it stands next to a liar (in any case he can tell the truth).
Each of them says: ``My neighbors come from different tribes''.
What is the smallest possible number of liars among them?
\solution
<FIXME: Missing English solution.>
