\problem
Given a point $Q$ inside a convex polyhedron $M$.
A line $\ell$ passes through $Q$ and intersects the surface of $M$ at points
$A$ and $B$.
Prove that for infinitely many of lines $\ell$ the equality $AQ = BQ$ holds.
\solution
Let $M'$ be a polyhedron symmetric to $M$ with respect to $Q$.
Then $Q \in M \cap M' \neq \emptyset$.
Moreover, since the volumes of $M$ and $M'$ are equal, none of them is
contained in the other.
Consequently, the surfaces of $M$ and $M'$ have nonempty intersection which
contains infinitely many points (really it contains some segment).
For any point $A$ lying on the both surfaces, the line $\ell = AQ$
satisfies the property mentioned in the problem.
