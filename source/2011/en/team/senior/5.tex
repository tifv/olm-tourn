A circle of area $1$ is given.
For a set of points $A$ within the circle and a diameter $d$ of the circle, we
denote by $A_d$ the set symmetric to $A$ with respect to $d$.
Does there exist a set $A$ of area $1/2$ within the circle, such that the
intersection $A\cap A_d$ has the area $1/4$ for each diameter $d$?
