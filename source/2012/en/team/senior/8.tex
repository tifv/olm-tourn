Two circles $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are tangent at point $T$.
Two lines $a$ and $b$ through $T$ intersect the circle $\gamma_1$ again at $A$ and $B$
respectively, and intersect $\gamma_2$ again at $A_1$ and $B_1$ respectively.
Let $X$ be a point in the plane, not lying on either circle nor on either of the lines
$a$ and $b$.
The circumcircles of triangles $ATX$ and $BTX$ intersect $\gamma_2$ again at $A_2$ and
$B_2$ respectively.
Prove that the lines $TX$, $A_1 B_2$ and $A_2 B_1$ are concurrent.
